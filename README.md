# clim

**clim** is a handy Java module for building various menus (ordinal, nominal, parametric).  
Please note, every release are alpha, so using this library will be sometimes funky...  
*(...or annoying.)*  

Well, I'll try my best *(and every contribution is appreciated)*,  
so some day **clim** will be as good  as I hope it will.  
  
  
## Import clim

This is pretty easy thanks to [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/).  
You find handy guides for *gradle*, *maven*, *sbt* and *leiningen* too.  
First of all, click on the badge of the current release:  
[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/hu.zza/clim.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#hu.zza/clim)  
*(...and the site will help you to import it.)*  


## Building the menu

There are builders to make it quick and easy. The main steps:  

- Building the structure of the menu
- Building the parameter matcher *(optional)*
- Building the menu with built components
