**clim** is a handy Java module for building various menus (ordinal, nominal, parametric).  
Please note, every release are alpha, so using this library will be sometimes funky...  
*(...or annoying.)*  

Well, I'll try my best *(and every contribution is appreciated)*,  
so some day **clim** will be as good  as I hope it will.
